## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 22+ (for web apps)
- Maven 3.9+

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/payflow.git
cd payflow
```

2. Start infrastructure services
```bash
docker compose --profile infra up -d
```

3. Build all services
```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

4. Run services locally
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -pl src/payment-service -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

5. Start the frontend
```bash
cd frontend/payment-page && npm run dev
```

## Code Style

### Java

- Follow the Google Java Style Guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Import ordering: standard Java, third-party, project-specific
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Write meaningful Javadoc for public APIs
- Use Lombok annotations where appropriate

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use semicolons
- Prefer const over let, let over var
- Write JSDoc for public functions
- Keep components small and focused

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PaymentService`)
- **Methods/variables**: camelCase (e.g., `processPayment`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- **Packages**: lowercase (e.g., `com.payflow.payment`)

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific service tests
mvn test -pl services/payment-service

# Run with coverage
mvn test -pl services/payment-service -Djacoco.skip=false
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd web/payment-page
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Requirements

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting
- Aim for high test coverage (>80% for new code)
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

## Security

### Sensitive Data

- **NEVER** commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Use environment variables or Spring profile defaults (see `application-docker.yml` for dev values)
- Report security vulnerabilities via the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)

### Security Scanning

Contributors should be aware of our security scanning practices:

- Pre-commit hooks run TruffleHog to prevent secrets from being committed
- CI/CD pipeline includes Hadolint for Dockerfile linting
- Container images are scanned with Trivy for vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are regularly updated via Dependabot
- Static analysis is performed with SonarQube

### Payment Security

- Never log sensitive payment data (card numbers, CVV, etc.)
- Follow PCI DSS compliance guidelines
- Use tokenization for payment methods

## Documentation

- Keep README.md up to date
- Update API documentation when endpoints change
- Document breaking changes in release notes
- Add Javadoc comments to complex logic
- Update architectural diagrams when needed
- Add inline code comments for non-obvious logic

## Community

- Be respectful and considerate of others
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Give credit where credit is due
- Stay constructive in discussions
- Follow the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Getting Help

If you need help with your contribution, please:
- Check existing issues and documentation
