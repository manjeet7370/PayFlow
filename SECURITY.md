## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by one of these methods:

1. **Email**: security@payflow.dev
2. **GitHub**: Create a private security issue
3. **Responsible Disclosure**: See our vulnerability disclosure policy below

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Response**: Within 7 days indicating how we'll address the vulnerability
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Hotfix/patch within 48 hours for severity critical
- **Medium/Low**: Fix included in next release cycle

For critical vulnerabilities, we will work with you to develop a mitigation strategy while we prepare a patch.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

1. Do not publicly disclose until we release a fix
2. Provide reasonable disclosure timeline (typically 90 days)
3. Credit reporters in security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

This project follows these security practices:

### Code Security
- No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- All secrets via environment variables
- Input validation and sanitization
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security code reviews

### Dependency Security
- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Container image scanning (Trivy)
- Maven dependency checks
- npm audit integration
- Dockerfile linting with Hadolint
- Secret detection with TruffleHog (pre-commit)

### Infrastructure Security
- TLS/SSL for all external communication
- Database encryption at rest
- Redis password protection
- JWT with secure signing (HS512)
- Rate limiting (1000 req/min via Redis)
- API key authentication for merchants

### Payment Security
- PCI DSS compliant architecture
- Card data tokenization (never stored)
- Stripe/PayPal/Razorpay direct integration
- Idempotency keys for payment processing

## Security Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Dependabot | Automated dependency updates |
| Trivy | Container & filesystem vulnerability scanning |
| SonarQube | Static code analysis |
| OWASP | Security best practices |
| JWT | Token-based authentication |

## Secure Development Guidelines

1. Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
2. Use environment variables or Spring profile defaults
3. Sanitize all user inputs
4. Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
5. Implement proper error handling (don't leak sensitive data)
6. Follow secure coding practices from OWASP Top 10

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Potential fix (if any)
- Your name/contact (for credit, optional)
